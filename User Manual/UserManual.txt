Taking the quiz:
In the folder you will find a file titled index.html. When you open that file, it 
will bring you to the webpage containing the quiz. If you click the Select Quiz button, 
it will hide the questions. Under the Select Quiz button you will see three different 
quizzes: Java, Python, and HTML. Click on the quiz of your choice and begin. Once the 
quiz starts you will have 2 minutes to complete 10 questions. If you get a question 
correct you will earn 10 points, but if you get the question wrong you will earn 
0 points. Once the quiz is over, you will see your total score. If you want to, 
you can type your name into the white box and save your high score. If not, 
you can choose to play again, or go home to take a quiz for another subject.

Editing the quiz:
If you want to change questions for a quiz, first you need to find the JavaScript file 
for the subject that you want to change. For example, if you want to change a question 
for the Java quiz, you need to open java.js. Once you find the JavaScript file you are 
looking for, scroll down until you find a comment that says �// Creating question 
objects�. Inside each question function there is a different question, and every 
choice function are the possible answers for the question provided. The answer function 
should be an integer. That integer is going to be the choice selection number that has 
the correct answer is on.
If you want to increase the number of questions and add a new question find a comment 
that says �//CONSTANTS�. When you find it, 
there are two variables: CORRECT_BONUS and MAX_QUESTIONS. 
Change the integer numbers to the number of questions you want to have.

Edit the timer:
Open the timer.js file and open it. �let seconds� and �let minutes� 
should be the number of minutes and seconds you want the quiz to be. 
It is currently set at 2 minutes and 1 second.
