Project Progress Report

	So far, we have made a functioning web-based quiz application. The user is able to 
    answer 10 questions.  The application features a progress bar, visual cues to right 
    or wrong answers, and score board. At the conclusion of the quiz, the user is able 
    to enter their name for inclusion in the high score table.

    Systems Programming, etc.
•	Add additional questions
